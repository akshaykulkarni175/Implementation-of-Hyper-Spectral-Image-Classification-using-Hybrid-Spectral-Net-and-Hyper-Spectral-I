# Implementation-of-Hyper-Spectral-Image-Classification-using-Hybrid-Spectral-Net-and-Hyper-Spectral-I

implementation of the Hybrid Spectral Net model for the land-cover classification of Hyper Spectral Images (HSI) and the Deep Slow Feature Analysis (DSFA) for land-cover Change Detection (CD). HSI analysis is an emerging field and has its footprints in sections ranging from agriculture to security. 
The neural network architecture used for Hybrid Spectral Net is a combination of 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional convolution neural network. The methodology for change detection utilises the power of deep networks along with Slow Feature Analysis algorithm.
